## Testing Recommendations:

1. Test each dessert with dairy allergy - should show garnish substitutions
2. Test each dessert with egg allergy - should show garnish substitutions
3. Test each dessert with gluten allergy - should show "none, this dish has been pre-prepared" (except flourless chocolate cake)
4. Test flourless chocolate cake with gluten allergy - should show safe (no gluten)
5. Test desserts with tree nut allergy - should show appropriate messages
