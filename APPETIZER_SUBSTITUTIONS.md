2. ✅ Updated gluten substitutions to use descriptive names (e.g., "NO garlic crouton" instead of "NO croutons")
3. ✅ Updated egg substitutions to use descriptive names (e.g., "NO mustard mayonnaise" instead of "NO mayonnaise")
4. ✅ Enhanced dairy substitutions to use most specific ingredient names
5. ✅ Pre-prepared foods correctly show "none, this dish has been pre-prepared" for main ingredients
6. ✅ Garnishes and toppings are correctly identified and can be substituted even in pre-prepared foods
