## Key Improvements Made:

1. ✅ Added 20+ new composite ingredients for entrees
2. ✅ Enhanced bread detection to prioritize specific types (English muffin, brioche, buttery onion bun, etc.)
3. ✅ Improved dairy detection to handle specific cheeses (American, Swiss, jalapeno jack, white cheddar)
4. ✅ Enhanced gluten detection for all bread types
5. ✅ Added marinade and spice blend breakdowns
6. ✅ Handled special cases (steak butter, pre-mark butter for steaks)
7. ✅ Composite ingredients show sub-ingredients in substitutions

---

## Special Handling:

### Steaks:
- All steaks automatically have "pre-mark butter" and "steak butter" for dairy allergies
- Shows: "NO steak butter" and "NO pre-mark butter"

### Pre-Prepared Items:
- Nightly specials that are pre-prepared show appropriate messages
- Garnishes can still be substituted

### Bread Types:
- System now detects and shows specific bread names:
  - "NO sesame seed bun" instead of "NO bun"
  - "NO buttery onion bun" instead of "NO bun"
  - "NO English muffin" instead of "NO bread"
  - "NO brioche bread" instead of "NO bread"

---

## Testing Recommendations:

Test these key scenarios:
1. **Sandwich with multiple allergens** - should show all specific ingredients
2. **Steak with dairy allergy** - should show steak butter and pre-mark butter
3. **Seafood with composite ingredients** - should show sub-ingredients
4. **Brunch items** - should handle eggs, dairy, gluten properly
5. **Nightly specials** - should handle pre-prepared vs modifiable correctly
